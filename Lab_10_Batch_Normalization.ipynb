    "# Lab: Batchnormalization Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a batchnormalization layer?\n",
    "It is a layer that normalize the output before the activation layer. [The original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167) was proposed by Sergey Ioffe in 2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "Batch Normalization Layer looks like this: ![bn](https://kratzert.github.io/images/bn_backpass/bn_algorithm.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why batchnormalization?\n",
    "The distribution of each layer's input changes because the weights of the previous layer change as we update weights by the gradient descent. This is called a covariance shift, which makes the network training difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the activation layer is a relu layer and the input of the activation layer is shifted to less than zeros, no weights will be activated!\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing also worth mentioning is that $\\gamma$ and $\\beta$ parameters in $$ y = \\gamma \\hat{x} + \\beta $$ are also trainable. \n",
    "\n",
    "**What it means is that if we don't need the batchnormalization, its parameters will be updated such that it offsets the normalization step.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, assume that\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\gamma &= \\sqrt{\\sigma^2_B + \\epsilon}\\\\\n",
    "\\beta &= \\mu_B\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "then\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y_i = \\gamma \\hat{x_i} + \\beta = x_i $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ are computed using moving averages during the training step. However, during the test time, the computed $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ will be used as fixed\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "- Always use the batch normalization!"
